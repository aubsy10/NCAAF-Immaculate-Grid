Here is my NCAAF Grid Guessing Game Project.

The Grid-Client folder contains all of the front-end code I wrote using React, while the Grid-Server folder contains the backend code I developed with Node.
Note that if this code is downloaded, it will not run as it relies a MySQL database, this code is meant to be hosted I just never ended up doing that.
